# CPPNOTEPAD
This is a simple notepad application I am building to learn more about the Qt platform and more about application and version control development with C++ and Git.

# FEATURES
- Edit files, make new text  files and save them.
- Change font, font color, and background color

# INSTALL
Compile the source code from releases with the binaries or use the [Installer app](https://www.mediafire.com/file/dymf2d1y250w2a6/cppnotepad_setup.exe/file)
**NOTE**: Since this is an unsigned application from the internet, your OS will recommend not installing it. To run it, on Windows click "Run Anyway" and install. The source code of 'master' is up to date with the current installer release.
